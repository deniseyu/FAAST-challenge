Week 1's weekend challenge to build a new series of tubes for Boris

The FAAST system will cater for the following:

There will be a number of trains inside the system.
Trains will travel from station to station.
Inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the carriages of the train.
A Passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station.
Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers.
Each train is made of a number of coaches.

Bonus: If you want to impress the mayor of London even more you will add a charging system where the passengers can only touch in a station (and access the train) if their account has more than 2 GBP.
